        <p id="p1">I am Puneet K. Maan I am 11 years old. I live in the U.S but I was born in India. India is the best Place ever! When I was 5 years old we moved to California,Los Angeles my aunt also moved with us and my other aunt invited us here. One year later we moved into Bakersfield,CA.<br>The crazy thing is I had to go to 3rd grade 3 times because in India when we were about to move I was in the middle of 3rd grade in LA they put me in 2nd grade in Bakersfield I was again in 2nd grade. My aunts family and my family lived in an apartment. We moved into another apartment and then We bought a house a month after my 11th birthday. I didn't know anybody around the neighborhood so instead me and my brother(ps.my brother is 9 years older than me he's 19.) would play together in the backyard. We would play tennis, volleyball,basketball, and play tag.Then, I started to get to know the girls in my neighborhood I started playing with them. Also, since I was a little kid their was one thing that always caught my interest's and that my friends and family members and enemies was coding.<br>I was always into techy stuff espesially coding.
            My dad found a company that taought coding to kids and I was one of those kids that learnt how to code and the my inerests in coding begin to rise and here I am making my very own website.
